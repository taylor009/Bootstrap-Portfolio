                <p>My love for computer began at a very young age. My father being a Software Engineer, we had computer parts all over our house.
                    My father taught me when I was five years old how to build and assemble computers.
                    I grew up wanting to be just like him.
                    My father has accomplished so much like revolutionizing web services by being the first bare metal dedicated server provider.
                    I've worked for the past five years for my father as an apprenticeship.
                    He has taught me the same way he learned to become who is today, and that's by learning from the hardware up.
                    Learning about the physical servers first gives me an understanding of what exactly I'm programming to and what each server can handle as far as differences in loads.
                    My goal is that I want to become better than my father and set the bar at the highest level. I'm looking forward to making an impression on the world in my own way.</p>
